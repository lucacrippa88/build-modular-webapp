# Build a modular website

Are you tired about Content Management Systems limitations? Do you want to express your creativity but are you scared by the blank coding page?
You should start here!


## The manifesto

This project aims to enable people defining theirselves both artists and developers to express their creativity.
This project is a framework containing a set of functions, structures, concepts and conventions that could help a developer to create a custom website, without loosing control of the code underlying.
This is a modular project: each function, with its dependencies, is defined and described apart, and can be applied on each graphic template you are planning to use. 
This framework, moreover, can be installed on a php server running on each type of hosting or cloud platform.


## Structure

This project is based ona 3 layer architecture, with the web layer, the application layer and the database layer. The web layer is composed by a classic html/css/javascript structure, and can be created using any graphic template. The javascript included in this project dynamically creates and fills the structures, and it's based on a couple of functions described in the wiki pages. The php code in the application layer performs queries on the MySQL database and interacts with other Cloud Services like IBM Watson Assistant to allow Admins to speed up post drafting.
