# Build a modular website

Are you tired about Content Management Systems limitations? Do you want to express your creativity but are you scared by the blank coding page?
You should start here!


## The manifesto

This project aims to enable people defining theirselves both artists and developers to express their creativity.
This project is a framework containing a set of functions, structures, concepts and conventions that could help a developer to create a custom website, without loosing control of the code underlying.
This is a modular project: each function, with its dependencies, is defined and described apart, and can be applied on each graphic template you are planning to use. 
This framework, moreover, can be installed on a php server running on each type of hosting or cloud platform.


## Structure

To be updated.
